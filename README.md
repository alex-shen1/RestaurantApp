### Secret Setup

Download the `.env` file from our Google Drive and put it in the root folder when you clone the repository â€” it holds our Google API key, which is secret so nobody else can use it.

### Building

Go to the root folder and run `npm run deploy` in console to deploy your version to the github.io page.
